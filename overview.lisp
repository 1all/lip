starting with nothig
we define how t coerce a string to a simple item

simpel item can live in items

and example is an item (perhaps with some other ifnroamtion)

examples live in samples. columns of samples divide into x,y, all (and something is not ix x,y if we are ignorning it)

files of data generate different coumns and examples

using the x-values
- exapels divide into clusters
- clsuters have ranges
-  some ranges have contrasting values (different freqeuences in one cluster than another)
- trees are generating by recursiveng dividing n the strongest contast.

using the y-vaues, we can rank sub-clsuters, perhaps infnrng sum. 
- planning means:
    - build the tree
    - walk the tree, selecting best cluster
    - benachmarking: find best leaf call it best
